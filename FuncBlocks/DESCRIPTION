Description: The package FuncBlocks performs GO-enrichment analyses 
		and provides functions that facilitate the interpretation
		of the results.
		The core function 'go_enrich' takes as input either candidate
		and (optional) background genes, or genes together with 
		user-defined scores. It then uses the hypergeometric or
		wilcoxon rank-sum test to test GO-categories for enrichment 
		of candidate or high-scored genes, respectively. 
		'go_enrich' interfaces the ontology enrichment software FUNC,
		which uses random permutations of candidate and background
		or score assignments of genes to compute a family-wise error
		rate to account for multiple testing.
		Additional functions provided in this package like
		'get_anno_genes', which returns the genes annotated to
		given GO-categories, and 'get_names', 'get_parent_nodes'
		and 'get_child_nodes' can be used to explore the GO-graph
		and help to interpret the results of the enrichment
		analyses.
