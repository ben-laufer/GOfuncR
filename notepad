compileAttributes()

# check that values of some sample anaylses still match "tests/saved_results.RData" (or set them)

# TODO
() add silent option
() in get children and get parents multiple entries for the same parent/child with differing distances are possible - is that still the case? if so, delete duplicates and keep only shortest distance

() print or return version of ontology, annotations, (gene-coords for gene_len and regions)
() also return total number of annotated genes
() add plot for wilcoxon (plot_scores: gos -> distribution/density of scores compared to root, violin?)
() maybe use one generic plotting function instead of plot_odds / plot_scores...
() wilcoxon for genomic regions? - try out if easy to implement
() add binomial and contingancy tests
() refinement from Func (either use c++ or reimplement in R)
() FDR?
() overall-significance?

() GRCh38 option for gene-coordinates

() allow user-defined term-tables (GO-graph) (-> roots named explicitly or infer from term[,3]?)
() allow user-defined GO-annotations
() allow user-defined gene_coordinates (?)
() update-functions for the previous 3? (biomaRt, ensembldb packages?)

() e.g. in get_anno_genes return NULL (as now) or rather an empty dataframe identical to normal output?
() visualization (email janet - plotting GO-categories)

() add testthat scripts
() add help-pages 
() add vignette (include table with versions of GO-tree and annotations)
() remove check for FWER-order before publication
