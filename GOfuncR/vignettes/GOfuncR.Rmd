# GOfuncR: Gene Ontology Enrichment Using FUNC

Package: GOfuncR  
Author: Steffi Grote  
Date: October 05, 2017  


## Overview
`r Biocpkg('GOfuncR')` performs a gene ontology enrichment analysis for human and mouse genes based on the ontology enrichment software FUNC [1,2]. It provides the standard candidate vs. background enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test, as well as three additional tests: (i) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is used when genes are ranked (ii) a binomial test that can be used when genes are associated with two counts, e.g. amino acid changes since a common ancestor in two different species. (iii) a Chi-square or Fisher's exact test that is used in cases when genes are associated with four counts, e.g. non-synonymous or synonymous variants that are fixed between or variable within species.  
To correct for multiple testing and interdependency of the tests, family-wise error rates are computed based on random permutations of the gene-associated variables (see [Schematic 1](#hyper_scheme) below). `r Biocpkg('GOfuncR')` also provides tools for exploring the ontology graph and the annotations, and options to take gene-length or spatial clustering of genes into account during testing. The gene ontology (obtained from geneontology.org), the annotations and the gene-coordinates (both obtained from biomart) are integrated in the package and updated regularly.

## Examples   

### Test gene set enrichment using the hypergeometric test
The hypergeometric test evaluates the over- or under-representation of a set of candidate genes in GO-categories, compared to a set of background genes (see [Schematic 1](#hyper_scheme) below).
The input for the hypergeometric test is a dataframe with two columns: (1) a column with gene-symbols and (2) a binary column with `1` for a candidate gene and `0` for a background gene.

#### Hypergeometric test using the default background gene set
The declaration of background genes is optional. If only candidate genes are defined, then all remaining genes from the internal dataset are used as default background.  
In this example GO-enrichment of 13 human genes will be tested:

```{r} 
## load GOfuncR package
library(GOfuncR)
## create input dataframe with candidate genes
gene_ids = c('NCAPG', 'APOL4', 'NGFR', 'NXPH4', 'C21orf59', 'CACNG2', 'AGTR1', 'ANO1', 
  'BTBD3', 'MTUS1', 'CALB1', 'GYG1', 'PAX2')
is_candidate = rep(1, length(gene_ids))
input_hyper = data.frame(gene_ids, is_candidate)
input_hyper
```

This dataframe is the only mandatory input for `go_enrich`, however to lower computation time for the examples, we also lower the number of randomsets that are generated to compute the FWER:

```{r, results='hide'} 
## run enrichment analysis (n_randets=100 lowers compuation time compared to default 1000)
res_hyper = go_enrich(input_hyper, n_randset=100) 
```

The output of `go_enrich` is a list of 3 elements: 
The most important is the first element which contains the results from the enrichment analysis (ordered by FWER for over-representation of candidate genes):

```{r}
stats = res_hyper[[1]]
## top-GO categories
head(stats)
## top GO-categories per domain
by(stats, stats$ontology, head, n=3)
```
The second element is a dataframe with all valid input genes and the third element states the reference genome for the annotations:

```{r}
## all valid input genes
head(res_hyper[[2]])
## reference genome used (default=grch37)
res_hyper[[3]]
```

#### Hypergeometric test using a defined background gene set

To define a background gene set, just add lines to the input dataframe where the gene-associated variable in the second column is a `0`:

```{r}
candi_gene_ids = c('NCAPG', 'APOL4', 'NGFR', 'NXPH4', 'C21orf59', 'CACNG2', 
 'AGTR1', 'ANO1', 'BTBD3', 'MTUS1', 'CALB1', 'GYG1', 'PAX2')
bg_gene_ids = c('FGR', 'NPHP1', 'DRD2', 'ABCC10', 'PTBP2', 'JPH4', 'SMARCC2', 'FN1', 'NODAL',
 'CYP1A2', 'ACSS1', 'CDHR1', 'SLC25A36', 'LEPR', 'PRPS2', 'TNFAIP3', 'NKX3-1', 'LPAR2', 'PGAM2')
is_candidate = c(rep(1,length(candi_gene_ids)), rep(0,length(bg_gene_ids)))
input_hyper_bg = data.frame(gene_ids = c(candi_gene_ids, bg_gene_ids), is_candidate)
head(input_hyper_bg)
tail(input_hyper_bg)
```

The enrichment analysis is performed like before, again with only 100 randomsets to lower computation time.
```{r, results='hide'}
res_hyper_bg = go_enrich(input_hyper_bg, n_randsets=100)

```
```{r}
head(res_hyper_bg[[1]])
```


#### Hypergeometric test with correction for gene length

If the chance of a gene to be discovered as a candidate gene is higher for longer genes (e.g. the chance to have an amino-acid change compared to another species), it can be helpful to also correct for this length-bias in the calculation of the family-wise error rate.
`go_enrich` therefore offers the `gene_len` option: While with the default `gene_len=FALSE` candidate and background genes are permuted randomly in the randomsets (see [Schematic 1](#hyper_scheme)), `gene_len=TRUE` makes the chance of a gene to be chosen as a candidate gene in a randomsets dependent on its gene length.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## test input genes again with correction for gene length
res_hyper_len = go_enrich(input_hyper, gene_len=TRUE)
```  

#### Hypergeometric test with genomic regions as input

Instead of defining candidate and background genes explicitly in the input dataframe, it is also possible to define entire chromosomal regions as candidate and background regions.
The GO-enrichment is then tested for all genes located in, or overlapping the candidate regions on the plus or the minus strand.
In comparison to defining candidate and background genes explicitly, this option has the advantage that the FWER accounts for spatial clustering of genes.
For the random permutations used to compute the FWER, blocks as long as candidate regions are chosen from the merged candidate and background regions and genes contained in these blocks are considered candidate genes ([Schematic 2](#block_scheme)).

To define chromosomal regions in the input dataframe, the entries in the first column have to be of the form `chr:start-stop`, where `start` always has to be smaller than `stop`.
Note that this option requires the input of background regions.
If multiple candidate regions are provided, in the randomsets they are placed randomly (but without overlap) into the merged candidate and background regions.

```{r} 
## create input vector with a candidate region on chromosome 8
## and background regions on chromosome 7, 8 and 9
regions = c('8:81000000-83000000', '7:1300000-56800000', '7:74900000-148700000',
  '8:7400000-44300000', '8:47600000-146300000', '9:0-39200000', '9:69700000-140200000')
is_candidate = c(1, rep(0,6))
input_regions = data.frame(regions, is_candidate)
input_regions
```
```{r,results='hide'} 
## run GO-enrichment analysis for genes in the candidate region
res_region = go_enrich(input_regions, n_randsets=100, ref_genome='grch38')
```
The output of `go_enrich` for genomic regions is identical to the one that is produced for single genes.
The second element of the output list contains the candidate and background genes located in the user-defined regions:

```{r}
stats_region = res_region[[1]]
head(stats_region)
## see which genes are located in the candidate region
input_genes = res_region[[2]]
candidate_genes = input_genes[input_genes[,2]==1, 1]
candidate_genes
```

The gene coordinates used to identify those genes were obtained from biomart and are, like the GO-annotations, dependent on the `ref_genome`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# use hg20 or mouse gene coordinates to find genes located in the input regions
res_region_hg20 = go_enrich(input_regions, ref_genome='grch38')
res_region_mus = go_enrich(input_regions, ref_genome='grcm38')

```


### Test enrichment of high or low scored genes using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
When genes are not divided into candidate and background genes, but ranked by some kind of score, e.g. a p-value for differential expression, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test can be performed to find GO-categories where genes with high or low scores are over-represented. This example uses mouse genes ranked by random example scores:

```{r}
## create input dataframe with scores in second column
high_score_genes = c('Gck', 'Gys1', 'Hk2', 'Pygl', 'Slc2a8', 'Ugp2', 'Zwint', 'Engase')
low_score_genes = c('Cacng2', 'Ano1', 'Btbd3', 'Mtus1', 'Calb1', 'Pax2')
gene_scores = c(runif(length(high_score_genes),0.5,0.8), runif(low_score_genes, 0.1, 0.4))
input_willi = data.frame(gene_ids = c(high_score_genes, low_score_genes), gene_scores)
head(input_willi)
```
```{r, results='hide'}
res_willi = go_enrich(input_willi, test='wilcoxon', n_randsets=100, ref_genome='grcm38')
```

The output is analogous to the one for the hypergeometric test:
```{r}
head(res_willi[[1]])
```
Note that when p-values are used as scores, often one would want to look for enrichment of low ranks, i.e. low p-values (or alternatively use (1 - p-value) as score and check for enrichment of high-ranks).

### Test enrichment using the binomial test
When genes are associated with two counts, e.g. amino-acid changes since a common ancestor in two species, a binomial test can be used to identify GO-categories with an enrichment of genes with a high fraction of one of the counts compared to the fraction in root node. To perform the binomial test the input dataframe needs a column with the gene symbols and two additional columns with the corresponding counts:

```{r}
## create a toy example dataset with two counts per gene
high_A_genes = c('G6PD', 'GCK', 'GYS1', 'HK2', 'PYGL', 'SLC2A8', 'UGP2', 'ZWINT', 'ENGASE')
low_A_genes = c('CACNG2', 'AGTR1', 'ANO1', 'BTBD3', 'MTUS1', 'CALB1', 'GYG1', 'PAX2')
A_counts = c(sample(20:30, length(high_A_genes)), sample(5:15, length(low_A_genes)))
B_counts = c(sample(5:15, length(high_A_genes)), sample(20:30, length(low_A_genes)))
input_binom = data.frame(gene_ids=c(high_A_genes, low_A_genes), A_counts, B_counts)
head(input_binom)
```

In this example we also use the `domains` option to reduce the analysis to `molecular_function` and `cellular_component`. Also the `silent` option is used, which suppresses all output that would be written to the screen (except for warnings and errors):

```{r}
## run binomial test, excluding the 'biological_process' domain, suppress output to screen
res_binom = go_enrich(input_binom, test='binomial', n_randsets=100, silent=TRUE,
 domains=c('molecular_function', 'cellular_component'))
head(res_binom[[1]])
```

### Test enrichment using the 2x2-contingency table test
When genes are associated with four counts, e.g. non-synonymous or synonymous variants that are fixed between or variable within species, like for a McDonald-Kreitman test [3], the 2x2 contingency table test can be used. It can identify GO-categories which have a high ratio of (count_A / count_B) compared to (count_C / count_D):

```{r}
## create a toy example with four counts per gene
high_substi_genes = c('G6PD', 'GCK', 'GYS1', 'HK2', 'PYGL', 'SLC2A8', 'UGP2', 'ZWINT', 'ENGASE')
low_substi_genes = c('CACNG2', 'AGTR1', 'ANO1', 'BTBD3', 'MTUS1', 'CALB1', 'GYG1', 'PAX2', 'C21orf59')
subs_non_syn = c(sample(5:15, length(high_substi_genes), replace=TRUE), sample(0:5, length(low_substi_genes), replace=TRUE))
subs_syn = sample(5:15, length(c(high_substi_genes, low_substi_genes)), replace=TRUE)
vari_non_syn = c(sample(0:5, length(high_substi_genes), replace=TRUE), sample(0:10, length(low_substi_genes), replace=TRUE))
vari_syn = sample(5:15, length(c(high_substi_genes, low_substi_genes)), replace=TRUE)
input_conti = data.frame(gene_ids=c(high_substi_genes, low_substi_genes),
 subs_non_syn, subs_syn, vari_non_syn, vari_syn)
head(input_conti)

## the corresponding contingency table for the first gene would be:
matrix(input_conti[1, 2:5], ncol=2,
 dimnames=list(c('non-synonymous', 'synonymous'),c('substitution','variable')))
```
```{r, results='hide'}
res_conti = go_enrich(input_conti, test='contingency', n_randset=100)
```
The output is analogous to that of the other tests:

```{r}
head(res_conti[[1]])
```
Depending on the counts for each GO-category a Chi-square or Fisher's exact test is performed.
Note that this is the only test that is not dependent on the distribution of the gene-associated variables in the root nodes.

### <a name='plot_anno'></a> Plot distribution of gene-associated variables from an enrichment analysis
The function `plot_anno_scores` can be used to get a quick visual overview of the gene-associated variables in GO-categories, that were used in an enrichment analysis. `plot_anno_scores` takes a result from `go_enrich` as input together with a vector of GO-IDs. It then plots the combined scores of all input genes for the `go_enrich` analysis in each of the defined GO-categories. The type of the plot depends on the test that was used in `go_enrich`. 

For the hypergeometric test pie charts show the amounts of candidate and background genes that are annotated to the GO-categories and the root nodes (candidate genes in the colour of the corresponding root node). The top panel shows the odds-ratio and 95%-CI from fisher's exact test (two-sided) comparing the GO-categories with their root nodes. Note that `go_enrich` reports the the hypergeometric test for over- and under-representation of candidate genes which correspond to the one-sided fisher's exact tests.
```{r}
## hypergeometric test
top_gos1 = res_hyper[[1]][1:5, 'node_id']
# GO-categories with a high proportion of candidate genes
top_gos1
plot_anno_scores(res_hyper, top_gos1)

## hypergeometric test with defined background
top_gos2 = res_hyper_bg[[1]][1:5, 'node_id']
top_gos2
plot_anno_scores(res_hyper_bg, top_gos2)
```
For the wilcoxon rank-sum test violin plots show the distribution of the scores of genes that are annotated to each GO-category and the root nodes. Horizontal lines in the left panel indicate the median of the scores that are annotated to the root nodes. The wilcoxon rank-sum test reported in the `go_enrich` result compares the scores annotated to a GO-category with the scores annotated to the corresponding root node.

```{r}
## scores used for wilcoxon rank-sum test
top_gos3 = res_willi[[1]][1:5, 'node_id']
# GO-categories with high scores
top_gos3
plot_anno_scores(res_willi, top_gos3)
```

For the binomial test pie charts show the amounts of A and B counts associated with each GO-category and root node, (A in the colour of the corresponding root node). The top-panel shows point estimates and the 95%-CI of p(A) in the nodes, as well as horizontal lines that correspond to p(A) in the root nodes. The p-value in the returned object is based on the null hypothesis that p(A) in a node equals p(A) in the corresponding root node. Note that `go_enrich` reports that value for one-sided binomial tests.

```{r}
## counts used for the binomial test
top_gos4 = res_binom[[1]][1:5, 'node_id']
# GO-categories with high proportion of A
top_gos4
plot_anno_scores(res_binom, top_gos4)
```
Note that domain `cellular_component` is missing in that plot because it was excluded from the GO-enrichment analysis in the first place (`res_binom` was created using the `domains` option of `go_enrich`).  

For the 2x2 contingency table test pie charts show the proportions of A and B, as well as C and D counts associated with a GO-category. Root nodes are not shown, because this test is independent of the root category. The top panel shows the odds ratio and 95%-CI from Fisher's exact test (two-sided) comparing A/B and C/D inside one node. Note that in `go_enrich`, if all four values are >=10, a chi-square test is performed instead of fisher's exact test.

```{r}
## counts used for the 2x2 contingency table test
top_gos5 = res_conti[[1]][1:5, 'node_id']
# GO-categories with high A/B compared to C/D
top_gos5
plot_anno_scores(res_conti, top_gos5)
```

### <a name='graph'></a> Explore the GO-graph
The functions `get_parent_nodes` and `get_child_nodes` can be used to explore the ontology-graph. They list all higher-level GO-categories and sub-GO-categories of input nodes, respectively, together with the distance between them:

```{r}
## get the parent nodes (higher level GO-categories) of two GO-IDs
get_parent_nodes(c('GO:0051082', 'GO:0042254'))

## get the child nodes (sub-categories) of two GO-IDs
get_child_nodes(c('GO:0090070', 'GO:0000112'))
```
Note that a GO-category per definition is also its own parent and child with distance 0.  

<a name='get_names'></a> Since these functions use the GO-identifiers, it is convenient to use the `get_names` function to get the name of GO-IDs:
```{r}
## get the full names and domains of two GO-IDs
get_names(c('GO:0090070', 'GO:0000112'))
```

<a name='get_ids'></a> It is also possible to got the other way round and search for GO-categories given part of their name using the function `get_ids`:

```{r}
## get GO-IDs of categories that contain 'blood-brain barrier' in their names
bbb = get_ids('blood-brain barrier')
head(bbb)
```
Note that his is just a `grep(..., ignore.case=TRUE)` on the node names of the ontology.
More sophisticated searches, e.g. with regular expressions, could be performed on the table returned by `get_ids('')` which lists all non-obsolete GO-categories.


### Retrieve associations between genes and GO-categories

<a name='get_anno_g'></a> `GOfuncR` also offers the functions `get_anno_genes` and `get_anno_categories` to get annotated genes given input GO-categories, and annotated GO-categories given input genes, respectively.  
`get_anno_genes` takes a vector of GO-IDs as input, and returns all genes that are annotated to those categories. The optional argument `genes` to define the set of genes which is searched for annotations. This function implicitly includes annotations to child nodes. Like for `go_enrich` the parameter `ref_genome` defines the reference genome for the annotations (default='grch37').

```{r}
## find all genes that are annotated to GO:0000109
head(get_anno_genes(go_ids='GO:0000109'))

## find out wich genes from a set of genes
## are annotated to some GO-categories
genes = c('AGTR1', 'ANO1', 'CALB1', 'GYG1', 'PAX2')
gos = c('GO:0001558', 'GO:0005536', 'GO:0072205', 'GO:0006821')
anno_genes = get_anno_genes(go_ids=gos, genes=genes)
# add the names and domains of the GO-categories
cbind(anno_genes ,get_names(anno_genes$go_id)[,2:3])

## find all mouse-gene annotations to two GO-categories 
gos = c('GO:0072205', 'GO:0000109')
head(get_anno_genes(go_ids=gos, ref_genome='grcm38'))
```

<a name='get_anno_c'></a> `get_anno_categories` on the other hand uses gene-symbols as input and returns associated GO-categories:

```{r}
## get the GO-annotations for two random genes
anno1 = get_anno_categories(c('BTC', 'SPAG5'))
head(anno1)

## get the GO-annotations for two mouse genes
anno2 = get_anno_categories(c('Mus81', 'Papola'), ref_genome='grcm38')
head(anno2)
```

This function only returns direct annotations. To get also the parent nodes of the GO-categories a gene is annotated to, the function `get_parent_nodes` can be used:
```{r}
## get all annotations of NXPH4, inlcuding higher-level GO-categories
direct_anno = get_anno_categories('NXPH4')
direct_anno
parent_ids = unique(get_parent_nodes(direct_anno$go_id)[,2])
# add GO-domain
full_anno = get_names(parent_ids)
head(full_anno)
```


## Schematics

#### <a name='hyper_scheme'></a>Schematic 1: Hypergeometric test and FWER calculation

![FWER calculation](./Skizze_Fig1.png 'hypergeometric test and FWER')

The FWER for the other tests is computed in the same way: the gene-associated variables (scores or counts) are permuted while the annotations of genes to GO-categories stay fixed. Then the statistical tests are evaluated again for every GO-category.

#### <a name='block_scheme'></a>Schematic 2: `circ_chrom` option for genomic regions input

![genomic regions](./Skizze_Fig2.png 'options for genomic regions input')

To use genomic regions as input, the first column of the `genes` input dataframe has to be of the form `chr:start-stop`.
The option `circ_chrom` defines how candidate regions are randomly moved inside the background regions for computing the FWER.
When `circ_chrom=FALSE` (default), candidate regions can be moved to any background region on any chromosome, but are not allowed to overlap multiple background regions.
When `circ_chrom=TRUE`, candidate regions are only moved on the same chromosome and are allowed to overlap multiple background regions.
The chromosome is 'circularized' which means that a randomly placed candidate region may start at the end of the chromosome and continue at the beginning.
